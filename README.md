* **Guided Gameplay**: Step-by-step introduction with hints and tips for exploration.

##  Styling & Animations

* **Gradient backgrounds** for a modern aesthetic
(Multiple background gradient options are included in the CSS, already commented out. The best one has been hand-picked for the website, but you can experiment or customize by uncommenting any of the options in the body section of style.css.)
* **Responsive typography** for mobile screens using `@media` queries
* **Hover & fade animations** for interactive elements
* **Shadows and glow effects** to highlight clickable items



##  Mobile Responsiveness

* `@media (max-width: 480px)` adjustments for text size, container width, and layout
* Seed grid adapts with `flex-wrap` and spacing for smaller screens
* Mystery messages resize and reposition to prevent layout breaking



##  Credits
